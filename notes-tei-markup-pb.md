# Mark-up of pagebreaks

Mark-up of page breaks mirroring the print edition with `<pb ed="print">` and linking them to the facsimiles is done through manually adding the `<pb>` element with `@ed="print"` and `@n` providing the page number. The digital facsimiles are then linked automatically to `<surface>` children of `<facsimile>` with the help of the XSLT stylesheet [Tei-LinkFacsimile2Pb](xslt/Tei-LinkFacsimile2Pb.xsl). This has been completed for the following files.

- vol. 1: *done*
- vol. 2: *done*
- vol. 3:
- vol. 4: *done*
- vol. 5: i_48 to i_59 *done*
- vol. 6: i_60 to i_71 *done*
- vol. 7:
